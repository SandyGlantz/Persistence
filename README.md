# Test_PC: Persistence

****

I use a Mac - with Paralells for Windows 10.  
Sometimes the PC part of my computer doesn't play well with the Mac side.  
So this space is to test and work out those issues.
No real code here ...

Working out kinks with getting pc VS (2015 and 2017) to play with Mac VSCode and GitHub ...

Used this repo to play with all the editing and committing from various 
   pc Visual Studio versions with the native mac Git and GitHub with Visual Studio Code.
